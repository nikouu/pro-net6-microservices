My code following the examples in [Pro Microservices in .NET 6](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-7833-8)

Figured it's safe to post this as the the actual book example code is already publicly hosted here: https://github.com/Apress/pro-microservices-in-.net-6

Seems at the time of writing this the example code isn't fully complete ðŸ¤”ðŸš©.

- [Amazon reviews](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1484278321#customerReviews)

Stopped at chapter 4 due to missing/unclear code examples.
